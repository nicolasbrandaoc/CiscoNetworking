=============================WIRELESS===========================
TYPES OF IMPLEMENTATIONS:





WIRELESS BENEFITS TO THE BUSINESS

MOBILITY: provide mobile users with access so that they can roam around in the network without getting disconnected from the network
INSTALLATION SPEED AND SIMPLICITY: eliminate the need to pull cable trough walls and ceilings
REACH OF THE NETWORK: the network can be wxtended to places which can not be wired
MORE FLEXBILITY: easily adaptation to changes in the configuration of the network
REDUCED COST OF OWNERSHIP: if compared with wired connection, it brings lots of savings
SCALABILITY: suitable for a small number of users to large infrastructure networks that enable roaming over a broad area.


INTRODUCTION TO WIRELESS TOPOLOGIES

BASIC SERVICE SET - BSS
    the radio frequencu provided from an AP standardized over 802.11.
    service ser ID is used to help user to identify a particular RF broadcasted by an AP.

SSIDS DISTRIBUTED SERVICE SET
    it brings flexbility to create several subdivision (SSIDs) matching wired VLAN in a distributed invironment.
    AP implemented in mode access or trunk.

CRONTROLLER-LESS 
    reduction of complexity for small branches.
    natural extension of a switched network, connecting wirelesss SSIDs to wired virtual LANS at the access layer in the campus
    AP can be implemented in mode trunk or mode access if thats just one vlan

CONTROLLER BASED
    the wlan controller provides the ap configuration and also functions as a switch for all the wireless traffic. The wlan controller also consolidated management for the entire wireless network in one place.
    we can find many design to implement a controller based scenarios such as: Centralizaed, distributed and Flex Connect

CENTRALIZED
    brings the possibility of provide batch configs to simultaneous devices, saving time.
    the pitfall is that there is no redundancy whatsoever of WLC

DISTRIBUTED
    brings the same benefit of centralized as well as WLC redundancy in case of any device goes faulty
    the downside of this implementation is that it can become an expensive solution

REMOTE BRANCH
    its a less expensive solution
    WLC is located in a remote location controlling several branches
    Flex connect feature can be implemented as backup plan in case of WAN failure

CLOUD CONTROLLER
    zero base deployment, as all configs are done by the dashboard controller
    scalabre, as a broadband connection can be used.
